## What I Do

I'm a software engineer passionate about automation and supporting people. I love bridging the gap between development and operations while building and leading amazing teams.

    return map[string][]string{
        "languages":     {"Go", "Dart & Flutter", "Python", "JavaScript"},
        "infrastructure": {"Terraform", "Docker", "Kubernetes"},

        "passion":       {"Building scalable systems", "Mentoring"},
    }
}
```

## What Drives Me

- **Automation First**: Automate the monotony to free time for meaningful activities
- **People & Teams**: Leading projects and empowering teams to do their best work
- **Neurodivergent Perspective**: Bringing unique problem-solving approaches to complex challenges
- **Continuous Learning**: I'm self-taught and study daily to improve.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding or with my family, you'll find me:
